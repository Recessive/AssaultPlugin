# Campaign plugin

Made by Recessive (me). I do not give anyone permission to use this without asking first.

### Building a Jar

`gradlew jar` / `./gradlew jar`

Output jar should be in `build/libs`.


### Installing

Simply place the output jar from the step above in your server's `config/mods` directory and restart the server.
List your currently installed plugins/mods by running the `mods` command.
